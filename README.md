- #### ‚öô The Idea Behind This Project
      This Project started as a hobby and will always be a hobby of mine.
      I needed proxies for another project so I made my own proxy scraper because every scraper I tried wasn't good enough.
      I will continue the project as long as possible. If you have any wishes just open an issue here on Github.
      I will take a look at it and maybe I will add the feature in the future.
      Also if you like my work I would be greatful if you star this project <3
      Have a nice day my friend!
